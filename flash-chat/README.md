# Flash Chat ⚡️

I've built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
Through this project, I have learnt how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I've used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.
